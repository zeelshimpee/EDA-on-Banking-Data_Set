# EDA-on-Banking-Data_Set
In this repository, we will be exploring the Bank dataset using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The Bank dataset contains information about bank customers, their personal details, and the products and services they use.

# Dataset Description

The dataset is a fictional bank dataset with information about customers who have taken loans from the bank. It includes information such as age, job, marital status, education, credit history, and other attributes that may help us predict whether a customer will default or not.
The Bank dataset contains the following columns:

ID: Customer ID

Age: Age of the customer

Gender: Gender of the customer

Region: Region of the customer

Income: Annual income of the customer

Married: Marital status of the customer

Children: Number of children the customer has

Car: Whether the customer owns a car or not

# Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need to have Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Data Cleaning
Before we start with the EDA, we need to clean the data. This involves checking for missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies in the data.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Now that the data is cleaned, we can start with the EDA. We will start by looking at some basic statistics of the dataset.

# Analysis
In this section, we will use visualization tools to further explore the data and visualize relationships between variables. 
We will use various types of plots, such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots, to identify patterns and trends in the data.
